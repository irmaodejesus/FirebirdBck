# SYSADMIN - FIREBIRD BACKUPER

## Introduction

For system administrators (SYSADMIN), efficient database management is crucial to ensure the integrity and availability of critical organizational data. In the context of systems utilizing Firebird as their Database Management System (DBMS), implementing a backup script for their multiple databases becomes a fundamental operational requirement.

This automated script enables sysadmins to perform regular and reliable backups of all Firebird databases, thereby ensuring resilience against potential data loss. Here, we will delve into the development of an effective script to perform backups on multiple Firebird databases. From initial configuration to the implementation of scheduling and monitoring routines, SYSADMINS will be guided through a step-by-step process to create a simple, robust, and scalable backup system.

With this script in operation, SYSADMINS can enjoy greater peace of mind, knowing that their data is safeguarded by an automated and dependable backup process. Let's begin creating this essential solution for effective Firebird database management.

## Overview

## Limitations and recommendations for the use of backup scripts

These scripts are designed to create backups of multiple Firebird databases, tested with a total of 150GB and capable of handling growth up to 300GB, in a Linux environment. If the combined size of your databases exceeds 300GB, please use these scripts with caution and communicate their success or failure along with your scenario.

## Requirements of Hardware and Software

This script was developed to be tested in a virtualized environment using the XCP-NG Hypervisor, running on a fully virtualized Linux guest system.

The Linux guest is running Ubuntu 22, equipped with 12GB of memory, network bonded at 2Gbit/s, and configured with 1 CPU comprising 2 cores. Additionally, it features 3 hard drives: one for the operating system, another dedicated to the operational database, and a third drive allocated for supporting daily backup routines.

## Conclusion

Firebirdbcks is a comprehensive solution for backing up Firebird Database servers, offering robust features for data protection, security, and compliance. By implementing a strategic approach to backups and ensuring secure remote storage, Firebirdbcks provides peace of mind and reliability for businesses relying on Firebird databases.
